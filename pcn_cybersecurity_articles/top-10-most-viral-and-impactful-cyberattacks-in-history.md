<!-- USAGE INSTRUCTIONS -->

<!--

You can use this template to copy your chosen article data. Common editing software have features called 'find and replace' functions and you can use these features to replace all instances of a particular 'variable code'. However, it might be easier copying your data into the areas replacing 'variable code' content; also removing any 'single instance' of the square brackets.

Example of replacing variable codes:
====================================

            Example 1 (single instance):
            Original: The published date is [PUBLISHED-DATE].
            Replaced: The published date is Feb 23, 2023.

            Example 2 (double instance):
            Original: Here is [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]], a contributor.
            Replaced: Here is [ProfCyberNaught], a contributor.

**** HELPFUL HINT ****
======================

If you look at 'Example 2', the 'replaced' text still has [square brackets] because the 'variable code' was placed between markdown square brackets to begin with. It is important to make sure you do not accidentally remove markdown square brackets when they are needed for layout requirements.

            There are two locations within this template where this would apply: [[ARTICLE-TITLE]] and [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]]
            These two items when replaced should look similar to these examples: [This great article title] and [ProfCyberNaught]

1. **Stuxnet (2010)**: This malware was specifically designed to target industrial control systems, and was used to sabotage the Iranian nuclear program. It was able to spread through USB drives and targeted Siemens software, causing damage to centrifuges used in the enrichment of uranium. The attack was a clear demonstration of the potential for cyberattacks to cause physical damage.

2. **Sony Pictures Hack (2014)**: This hack was a major embarrassment for Sony, as sensitive information and emails were leaked to the public. The attackers, believed to be from North Korea, were motivated by the release of the film "The Interview," which depicted the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The hack also resulted in the cancellation of the film's release.

3. **WannaCry (2017)**: This ransomware attack affected more than 200,000 computers in over 150 countries. The malware spread rapidly through a vulnerability in the Windows operating system, encrypting files and demanding payment in Bitcoin. The attack caused widespread disruption, particularly in the UK, where the National Health Service was badly affected.

4. **Equifax Hack (2017)**: The personal information of 143 million Americans was compromised in this data breach, including social security numbers and birth dates. The hack was caused by a vulnerability in the company's website software, and resulted in a loss of trust for the credit reporting agency, as well as significant financial losses.

5. **NotPetya (2017)**: This malware, which was initially spread through a Ukrainian tax accounting software, quickly spread to cause disruption globally, causing damage to major companies such as Merck, Maersk, and FedEx. The malware was designed to encrypt files and make it difficult for the victims to recover their systems, it was later determined that the attack was likely state-sponsored and targeted Ukraine.

6. **Marriot Data Breach (2018)**: The personal data of around 500 million guests of the hotel chain was compromised in this data breach. The information included names, addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and other sensitive information. The breach was caused by a vulnerability in the company's Starwood guest reservation database, which had gone undetected for four years.

7. **Cloudbleed (2017)**: This data leak was caused by a buffer overflow in the content delivery network Cloudflare. The bug resulted in sensitive information, including passwords and private messages, being leaked to the internet. The leak affected a wide range of websites and services, and resulted in many users having to change their passwords and revoke their API keys.

8. **Triton (2017)**: This malware was discovered targeting industrial control systems in the Middle East. The malware was designed to target Schneider Electric's Triconex safety instrumented system controllers. It had the capability to cause physical damage, potentially leading to loss of life. The attack was likely state-sponsored and was used to target critical infrastructure.

9. **SolarWinds (2020)**: This sophisticated supply chain attack affected multiple US federal agencies, as well as private companies. The attackers used a vulnerability in the SolarWinds Orion software to gain access to the networks of the affected organisations. The attack was believed to have been carried out by a state-sponsored group, and resulted in a significant loss of trust in the security of the affected organisations.

10. **DarkHotel APT (2020)**: This APT group targeted high-profile individuals, mostly executives of large companies and government officials, through spear-phishing emails and watering-hole attacks. The group was known to be active since at least 2014, and it was able to evade detection for several years by using sophisticated tactics and tools. The group is believed to be state-sponsored and focused on intelligence gathering and espionage.
