<!-- USAGE INSTRUCTIONS -->

<!--

You can use this template to copy your chosen article data. Common editing software have features called 'find and replace' functions and you can use these features to replace all instances of a particular 'variable code'. However, it might be easier copying your data into the areas replacing 'variable code' content; also removing any 'single instance' of the square brackets.

Example of replacing variable codes:
====================================

            Example 1 (single instance):
            Original: The published date is [PUBLISHED-DATE].
            Replaced: The published date is Feb 23, 2023.

            Example 2 (double instance):
            Original: Here is [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]], a contributor.
            Replaced: Here is [ProfCyberNaught], a contributor.

**** HELPFUL HINT ****
======================

If you look at 'Example 2', the 'replaced' text still has [square brackets] because the 'variable code' was placed between markdown square brackets to begin with. It is important to make sure you do not accidentally remove markdown square brackets when they are needed for layout requirements.

            There are two locations within this template where this would apply: [[ARTICLE-TITLE]] and [[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]]
            These two items when replaced should look similar to these examples: [This great article title] and [ProfCyberNaught]
